# Mother is mothering

Mother is mothering is a python package that exists because I wanted to learn how to create python packages and I am, as most of us are, a Taylor Swift fan. Most importantly, perhaps, it is the fact that blondie always know what to say and sometimes the python girlies need some of her wisdom.
